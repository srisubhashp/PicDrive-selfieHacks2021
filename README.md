# PicDrive - Specialized Image Storage Platform Application 
This is a project which I submitted to SelfieHacks 2021 (An MLH Hackathon) in August 2021 and am currently working on it.
  
 
- Its a specialized image storage platform for markdown files and also a hub for technical content writers.
- As soon as we paste an image or any media file, a unique embedded code will be generated based on the platform you want to use it in.
- Image retrieval time from any GitHub repository is drastically reduced by 50 % as every repostory can be mapped to a collection in this platform.
- The application is being built React and utilizes Microsoft Azure for authentication and storage. 

Here's is a Figma small scale prototype of the final product : [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/FVFJ8pIR3NIbyHeLEQ4q4M/PicDrive-SelfieHacks2021?node-id=11%3A58&scaling=contain&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=8%3A13)
